At the moment the test cycle is 
- build a new image
- bring down the containers
- bring up new containers (volume-mount app/tests)
- exec into the containers and run the tests


It would be nice to 'overlay' app/source as a volume-mount
as well (in docker-compose.yml). This would allow server-side
tests to avoid the build/down/up cycle (which is quite slow on M1).
However, as is, it won't work. The reason is state. 
A test will write to files in the /cyber-dojo dir.
Some tests use a DiskFake which will be recreated on each test.
But not all. And certainly not the client-side tests.
At the moment /cyber-dojo is volume-mounted to a /tmp dir inside 
the container (in docker-compose.yml)

It would be better if /cyber-dojo was volume-mounted to
a dir off ${ROOT_DIR} (which would be added to .gitignore and .dockerignore).
Then a test cycle could simple reset this dir before each run.

Done for server. Not for client.

The same could be done for the coverage files which are 
currently tar-piped out of the /tmp dir inside the container.
