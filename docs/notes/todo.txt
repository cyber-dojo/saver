Move code from creator to saver
===============================

Currently the creator service is resonsible for 
- showing LTF and problem names
- getting the manifests for both choices
- combining the manifests
- asking saver to create a group/kata

It would be better if
- saver created a group/kata given the choices
  it would create the manifest itself from the start-points services

Further, it would be better if
- saver offered fork options for group/kata aswell.
- group_fork(id)
- kata_fork(id)

This would mean creator's job became solely UX.

So, concretely

- group_create(display_name, exercise_name, options={})
- group_create_custom(display_name, options={})
- group_fork(id)

- kata_create(display_name, exercise_name, options={})
- kata_create_custom(display_name, options={})
- kata_fork(id)

Note, in the future it might be possible to pass
multiple display_names to the create_ methods.
This would be for the feature where a single dashboard
could support a group containing katas from several LTF's
