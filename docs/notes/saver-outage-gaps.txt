Suppose there are two laptops both running as the same avatar.
  lion, hippo, both on 46

Now lion tries to make two commits 47,48, but there is a saver outage,
  and only on the third commit, 49 does it get through.

Then hippo makes a commit, 46 and it works because lion missed it.
So what this means is that when 49 gets through it has to fill in
'blanks' for 47 and 48. It can do this as tags; tag 46,47,48 will
all be for the same commit.
