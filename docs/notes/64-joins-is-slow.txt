Currently: group_join(id, indexes=(0..63).to_a.shuffle)

It would be better if the indexes were passed to group_create()
and then every group_join() used the same shuffled order which
could be reduced in size by one for each successful join.

Would also make all the group methods (except create) take
a single id argument.
