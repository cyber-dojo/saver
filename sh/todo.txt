Added junit output creation. Getting error
3.4.0/lib/minitest/ci_plugin.rb:115:in `+': TimeStub can't be coerced into Integer (TypeError)

        total_time += result.time

I think this is because time is being stubbed in a test and not restored.
No. It wasn't that.
It was test/server/helpers/externals.rb
  module TestHelpersExternals
    def externals
      @externals ||= Externals.new
    end
    ...
    def time
      externals.time
    end
  end

which was included a class scope in test/server/test_base.rb
class TestBase < Id58TestBase
  include TestHelpersExternals
  ...

I have commented out TestHelpersExternals.time so I can get MiniTest::Ci JUnit reporting.
